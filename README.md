### Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for building smart housing projects using recycled silicon-based microprocessors and microcontrollers in developing countries. The project encompasses various aspects, including supply chain management, database design, and user interface development.

### Business Overview

Alpha Tech. Homes Innovations, Inc. is a mid-sized company specializing in smart-home automation solutions. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of smart devices and systems for home automation, including smart lighting, security, and HVAC control.

The company has approximately 300 employees across multiple locations in the USA, India, and China. The primary office is located in Silicon Valley, California, with additional operations in Shenzhen, China (manufacturing), and New York City (sales and marketing).

### Supply Chain

The supply chain for Alpha Tech. Homes Innovations, Inc. involves the following raw materials:

1. Recycled silicon-based microprocessors and conductors
   * Source 1: Supplier A (China)
   * Source 2: Supplier B (Singapore)
2. Sensors (e.g., motion sensors, temperature sensors)
   * Source 1: Supplier X (Russia)
   * Source 2: Supplier Y (Germany)
3. Plastic enclosures and casings
   * Source 1: Manufacturer P (India)
   * Source 2: Manufacturer Q (Madagascar)

### Database Design

The project includes a database design to support the smart housing system. The database consists of the following entities:

1. **Smart Devices** : Stores information about various automation devices, such as smart bulbs, smart thermostats, and smart locks.
2. **User Profiles** : Represents individuals or users who interact with the smart home system.
3. **Automation Rules** : Contains predefined rules and conditions that govern how smart devices should behave and interact.
4. **Sensor Data** : Stores data generated by sensors installed in the smart home, providing information about temperature, motion, and security status.
5. **Maintenance Logs** : Keeps track of maintenance and service records for smart devices.

The database design also includes relationships between these entities, such as users owning one or more smart devices, devices having sensors and automation rules, and users using one or more smart devices.

### Database Implementation

The database implementation is done using MySQL. The project includes SQL scripts for creating the database schema and inserting sample data. Additionally, there are SQL queries demonstrating data retrieval, updates, and deletions.

### User Interface

The project includes a Python-based user interface that allows users to interact with the smart housing system. The user interface provides the following functionalities:

1. View Product Table
2. View Customer Information Table
3. View Sales Records
4. Place an Order

The user interface is built using the `tkinter` library and connects to the MySQL database using the `mysql.connector` module.
